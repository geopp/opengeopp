Building the library and test binary from Subversion repository:
----------------------------------------------------------------
The Sourceforge Subversion repository is to be found here:
svn co https://opengeopp.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/opengeopp/trunk/opengeopp opengeoppsvn

Then, you need the following packages (Fedora 11 names here, 
but names may vary according to distributions):
  * libtool, autoconf, automake
  * gettext-devel
  * gcc-c++
  * boost-devel
  * doxygen
  * tetex-latex (optional)
  * rpm-build

Building the library and test binary from the tarball:
------------------------------------------------------
The latest stable source tarball (opengeopp*.tar.gz or .bz2) can be found here:
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=xxxxxx

Then, as usual, you can just type the following sequence:
"./configure --prefix=/home/user/dev/deliveries/opengeopp-0.1.0 && make && make check && cd test && ./testLibsh"
Of course, if you want to install the library (libopengeopp*.so*),
just type: "make install".

See the INSTALL file for more details.
